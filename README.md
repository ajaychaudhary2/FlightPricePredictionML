# Flight Price Prediction

## Overview

Flight Price Prediction is a machine learning project aimed at predicting flight prices based on various parameters such as airline, source, destination, date of journey, departure time, arrival time, duration, and total stops. This project leverages data science techniques to provide users with an estimated price for their flight bookings, making it easier to plan their travel expenses.

## Features

- Predict flight prices based on user inputs
- User-friendly web interface for input collection
- Utilizes various machine learning algorithms for prediction, including:
  - Linear Regression
  - Lasso Regression
  - Ridge Regression
  - ElasticNet
  - Random Forest Regressor

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Flask (for web application)
- Pandas (for data manipulation)
- Scikit-learn (for machine learning)
- HTML/CSS (for frontend)
- Jupyter Notebook (for exploratory data analysis)

## Installation
